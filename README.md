# QHack-PennyLane-2022
Here are some exercises that I made for the QHack organized by PennyLane in 2022

*Remark*

These exercises are only for educational purposes. I am not responsible of the use you make of them. Also be aware that possible errors can be found on these exercises as they were done while I was doing my master thesis and I couldnÂ´t focus on the tournament.
I hope that these solutions give you a hint on how to solve them or help you for the future tournaments.

Have fun!
